    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Background</Heading><Text> Successful rehabilitation is essential to improve the physical and mental outcomes of people with lower limb amputation(s). Individuals have different goals and expectations of successful rehabilitation and experience issues that affect their quality of life.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Objectives</Heading><Text>To determine factors affecting lower limb prosthetic rehabilitation from people with amputation(s), important for studies focusing on prosthetic and socket design and fitting because they provide context of need and user issues.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Study design</Heading><Text>Thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. Methods: Ten people with amputation(s) were self-selected from a survey identifying factors affecting lower limb prosthetic rehabilitation. The telephone interviews were semistructured exploring the biggest impactors on and frustrations with rehabilitation and the socket. A thematic analysis was completed by following the undermentioned steps: familiarization, coding, generating themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and reporting.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Results</Heading><Text>Five distinct but interrelated themes were identified: External to Prosthesis, Body Impactors, Consequences of Ill-Fit, Prosthesis Irritants, and Work and Social Impact. Those living with amputation(s) mentioned prosthetic-related issues affecting their work and social life, including difficulties wearing their prosthesis all day, the socket's rigidity, and the ability to participate in hobbies.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Conclusions</Heading><Text>The study provides new insights into the issues experienced during prosthetic rehabilitation, highlighting impacts beyond just physical health consequences. The study provides an evidence base for areas of the rehabilitation journey which could be improved to improve the quality of life of people with amputation(s).</Text>

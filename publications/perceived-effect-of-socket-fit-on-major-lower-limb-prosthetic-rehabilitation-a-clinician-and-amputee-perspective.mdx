    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Design</Heading><Text>A survey was developed to identify rehabilitation factors and issues for prosthesis wearers and rehabilitation clinicians. Participants opted to participate in a further telephone interview.</Text>

    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Main Outcome Measures</Heading><Text>A survey and an interview to measure the perceived effect of socket fit on lower limb rehabilitation.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Results</Heading><Text>Issues related to socket fit were identified as the biggest factor affecting rehabilitation by 48.0% of amputees and 65.7% of clinicians. Amputee interviewees focused on the effect of fit on quality of life and the ability to complete daily tasks, whereas clinicians focused on the lack of widespread ability to adjust the socket and gait re-education.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Conclusions</Heading><Text>Socket fit has a large effect on and is a large source of frustration to amputees and their clinical teams throughout rehabilitation. From the interviews, it became clear that the interpretation of socket fit is different for each person; thus, “socket fit” does not mean the same for all patients.</Text>

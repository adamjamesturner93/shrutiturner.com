    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Background</Heading><Text> The worldwide number of individuals with lower-limb amputation(s) is expected to double from 2005 to 2050 due to ageing populations, on-going conflicts, and their landmine legacy. People with lower-limb loss are reported to have a lower quality of life and greater difficulty integrating into society.1,2 Successful rehabilitation is essential to improve their physical and mental outcomes; the psychosocial impacts on amputees’ lives can be as debilitating as the physical impact.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Aim</Heading><Text>To determine the factors perceived to impact lower-limb prosthetic rehabilitation from service users and rehabilitation clinicians to provide a basis for research, development, and policy priorities.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Method</Heading><Text>Ten service user and six clinician interviewees were self-selected from a survey which aimed to identify the issues associated with lower-limb prosthetic rehabilitation. The interviews were semi-structured with questions relating to the participants’ frustrations with rehabilitation and the prosthetic socket. The interviewees were asked to discuss three questions: the greatest impactor on rehabilitation; their biggest frustration with rehabilitation; and their greatest frustration with the socket. A thematic analysis was carried out to capture the information in the interviews. The following steps were implemented: familiarisation, coding, generating themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and reporting.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Results</Heading><Text>Six themes were identified: External to Prosthesis (e.g., disparity between service provision), Body Impactors (e.g. residuum volume fluctuation), Consequences of Ill Fit (e.g. socket discomfort), Prosthesis Irritants (e.g. reactions to liners), Limitations of Practice (e.g. reactive action to issues) and Work and Social Impact (e.g. inability to work). Service users mentioned prosthetic related issues impacting their work and social life, including the difficulties wearing their prosthesis all day, the socket’s rigidity, and the ability to participate in hobbies. Clinicians commented on service set up, logistic and staffing impacts on quality of care, including the advantages of having prosthetic and physiotherapy teams in the same location.</Text>
    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Discussion and Conclusion</Heading><Text>The study provides a variety of perspectives of service user and rehabilitation team priorities. Clinician and service user perspectives are coherent in most themes. The study confirms existing and provides new insights into the perceived priorities during prosthetic rehabilitation into areas that could be improved in the rehabilitation journey.</Text>

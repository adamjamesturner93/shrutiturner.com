    <Heading as={"h3"} size="md" fontWeight="bold">Abstract</Heading><Text>Obtaining a good socket fit is an iterative process dependent on the skill and experience of the prosthetist creating it and requires individualisation based on the size and shape. There is no standard measurement system used to aid prosthetic socket creation despite the severe impacts on physical health and quality of life if one is ill fitting. Pressure sensors embedded in a prosthetic socket were used to collect data at the socketâ€“residuum interface. To choose an interpolation method, the sensor array was simplified to a 2D grid with a border for extrapolation and tested using previously collected walking test pressure data. Four multivariable interpolation methods were evaluated to create a colour map of the pressure data. Radial basis function interpolation was chosen, as it produced a clear image with a graduated interpolation between data points, and was used to create a colour map across the surface of a 3D prosthetic socket model. For the model to be accessible to clinical audiences, a desktop application was created using PyQt to view the model. The application allowed for connection to the sensors via Bluetooth, with the pressure data updating on the 3D model in real time. Clinician feedback on the application showed the potential for a clinical product; however, further development informed by feedback from rehabilitation clinicians and prosthesis users is required.</Text>
